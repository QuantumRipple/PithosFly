Pithosfly
------

A fork for Pithos, a native Pandora Radio client for Linux, that saves the stream you are listening to disk.
It downloads, rips music intelligently, saving songs into mp3 files into individual folders based on artist and album. The files are properly tagged and the cover art is saved into the mp3.

There is now an option in the Setting Dialog to add your save-at Directory. A lot of work went into this, but Since I migrated it over the gsettings like Main updating will be a lot easier.

It compiles with the normal compile instructions for Main.

The original Pithos [homepage is here](http://pithos.github.io).

This fork follows the mainline code commits.
