Pithosfly
------

A fork for Pithos, a native Pandora Radio client for Linux, that saves the stream you are listening to disk.
It downloads, rips music intelligently, saving songs into mp3 files into individual folders, named after a radio stream. The files are properly tagged and the cover art is saved into the mp3.

Configure folder to save to by adding the following to pithos.ini (usually found in ~/.config/):

There is now An opion in the Setting Dialog to add you Save-at Diretory. A lot of work went into this, but Since I migrated it ofer the gsettings like Main updating will be a lot easier.

The original Pithos [homepage is here](http://pithos.github.io).

This fork follows the mainline code commits.
